    <p>Here's a picture of the bronze clevis pin I took out of the port idler sheave. The pin
    is 5/8&quot; in diameter. It had worn down to 1/8&quot;! Edson now recommends that all
    bronze clevis pins be changed to stainless steel ones.</td>

    <p><span lang="en-us">I've always had problems getting a tight seal on a 
	hose at a barb fitting. Double hose clamps worked, but they would invariably 
	leak or the hose would blow off the barb, even with two hose clamps. 
	Apparently the hose clamp deforms a nylon hose barb.</span></td>
