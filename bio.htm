				<p>Scott's been sailing since 1970, starting out on lakes and 
				then moving on to the Chesapeake Bay and further afield. He and 
				Sue have owned <i>Willow</i> since 1998. In that time, they have 
				logged over 21,000 miles, including over 18,000 ocean miles.</p>
				<p><i>Willow</i> and its crew have visited Bermuda, the Bahamas, 
				the Turks &amp; Caicos, Nova Scotia, Maine, and the ICW down to 
				Charleston, SC (our launching point for points southeast). Scott 
				and Sue keep <i>Willow</i> on Rock Creek (off the Patapsco 
				River) in Pasadena, MD. They have also extensively cruised the 
				middle and upper Chesapeake Bay.</p>
				<p>Scott wrote for, and was a contributing editor to, <i>
				Practical Sailor</i>. His articles have also appeared in <i>
				Blue Water Sailing</i> and <i>Good Old Boat</i> magazines.<p>
