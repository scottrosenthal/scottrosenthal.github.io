<h2>Cleaning</h2>

<p>Bronze cleaner - Dissolve 1 tsp salt in 1 cup white vinegar. Add enough flour to make a
paste. Apply paste to bronze and let sit for 15 minutes to 1 hour. Rinse with clean, warm
water and polish dry.</p>

<h2>Medical</h2>

<p>Ear infections - Prevent external ear infections by instilling one or two drops of an
(isopropyl) alcohol/vinegar solution into each ear after snorkeling or diving. Mix equal
parts of alcohol and white vinegar.</p>

<h2>Provisioning</h2>

<p>Fruits and vegetables - Stow apples and potatoes together to prevent potatoes from
sprouting.</p>

<p>Fruits and vegetables - Wrap vegetables and fruits individually in newspaper to prolong
freshness.</p>
